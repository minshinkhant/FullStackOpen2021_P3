# Exercises 3.13.-3.14.
The following exercises are pretty straightforward, but if your frontend stops working with the backend, then finding and fixing the bugs can be quite interesting.

## 3.13: Phonebook database, step1
Change the fetching of all phonebook entries so that the data is fetched from the database.

Verify that the frontend works after the changes have been made.

In the following exercises, write all Mongoose-specific code into its own module, just like we did in the chapter Database configuration into its own module.

## 3.14: Phonebook database, step2
Change the backend so that new numbers are saved to the database. Verify that your frontend still works after the changes.

At this point, you can choose to simply allow users to create all phonebook entries. At this stage, the phonebook can have multiple entries for a person with the same name.
